# BC2025 recipes: Updates of the 1973 Becker-Coppens extinction recipes

This branch of the repo contains the LaTeX code for producing the publication associated with the work. Please refer to the README.md in the main branch for how to cite this paper before or after it is published.

Compilation of the LaTeX sources in the `paper/` subdirectory is to be done with `pdflatex` and requires a suitable LaTeX installation (probably `sudo apt install texlive` is enough on Ubuntu 24 but that is not verified). For convenience the compilation can be carried out by stepping into the `paper/` subdirectory and running pdflatex. A convenience BASH script (`compile.x`) can be used to build it (not tested or supported outside of ubuntu of course).
